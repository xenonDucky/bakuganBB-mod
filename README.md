# bakuganBB-mod

this is a bakugan mod for ps2 where I changed some bakugan stats so it's more balanced and more show accurate.

it works on an pcsx2 emulator, I haven't tested it on others. Still haven't tested it on a real ps2.

this is a patch, so you need to download apache2 (https://www.psx-place.com/resources/apache-by-sonix-2004.697/) and the original bakugan iso. 
You then replace the SLUS folder with this one using apache.
